Hi Peter!

I think your project idea is pretty cool and am interested in being on the team.
I would be able to help out around the API, as I've used many APIs and feel like I've seen what can go wrong when making one.
I think business-wise it sounds like a good plan to have a rate-limited API that could then have paid aspects to increase the rate.
I see no problems legal wise with what you have written.

Sounds like it would be fun to make!
